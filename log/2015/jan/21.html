<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>The only progress was</p>
<ul>
<li><p>clean up of differential calc notes and proving that differentiability at <span class="math">\(a\)</span> implies continuity at <span class="math">\(a\)</span> (not recorded on computer yet though)</p></li>
<li><p>some understanding of how Braitenberg Vehicles 2-4 behave</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve decided I should probably try to read every day from each of Fleming, Lee and Beutler. Reading needs to go faster than its been going, because there are many other books I need to be reading as well. Heres a list of some of them as a reminder:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems and Linear Algebra</em> by Hirsch &amp; Smale</li>
<li><em>Variational Calculus and Optimal Control</em> by Troutman</li>
<li><em>Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</em> by Strogatz</li>
<li><em>Naive Lie Theory</em> by Stillwell</li>
<li><em>Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics</em> by McCarthy</li>
<li><em>Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics</em> by Arnold</li>
<li><em>Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics</em> by Sussman &amp; Wisdom</li>
<li><em>Reinforcement Learning</em> by Sutton &amp; Barto</li>
<li><em>Introduction to Topological Manifolds</em> by Lee</li>
<li><em>Elementary Differential Geometry</em> by O’Neill</li>
<li><em>First Steps in Differential Geometry</em> by McInerney</li>
<li><em>An Introduction to Manifolds</em> by Loring &amp; Tu</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, there are many books I’d <em>like</em> to read but don’t have time to. I should survey all the books I want to read and rank them by priority. Need to figure out how long that would take.</p>

<p>Work on derivatives notes. I did a pass over them and performed some editing/LaTeX cleanup.</p>
<p>I also took a look at Fleming’s proof that differentiability at a point implies continuity there. It uses the operator norm, and I think I have a proof (but it is only on paper, not in notes yet.</p>
