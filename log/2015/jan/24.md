I've been reading Abbott, Ch. 6. I am up to p 164, section 6.4 (after skipping a fair amount of 6.2). I also skipped much of Abbott's presentation of uniform convergence, preferring the material in *Metric Spaces* by O'Searcoid. 

I also have uniform convergence definition in notes.

Just finished reading an hour on Fleming. I managed to understand and take into notes the definition of $C^k$ and looked some at Fleming's proof that $C^1$ implies differentiability. I don't want to take a long time on this, so I should probably assume it's true and keep going.
