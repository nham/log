I was reading 3.2, hit the part about the heliocentric diff-eqns being representable as the gradient of some functions and got confused. I then tried to skip to 4.1 on the Two-body problem, but that used material from ch 3 (angular momentum).

So, instead I'm going to skip the gradient stuff and proceed to 3.2.2, "First Integrals". I also see that this gets into the virial theorem, which I've heard of before and look forward to reading about.

I spent some time working out my intuition with the center of mass. I got confused because there are scalar multiples $C \sum_0^n m_i x_i(t)$ with $C \neq \frac{1}{M}$ that are convex combinations of $x_i(t)$'s. What makes them not useful is that the same $C$ doesn't work for all $t$, I believe, unless $C = \frac{1}{M}$.
