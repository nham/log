# Summary

The "Summary" section is supposed to answer the question "What was I trying to do today, and how well did I do it?" I feel like I have gotten away from that question somewhat, so I will attempt to more explicitly answer it today.

What I was trying to do today was learn a lot. That will be the focus of most days, since there is a lot I need to learn, it seems.

Here are some things I did today in service of learning:

 - I re-worked the notes on torsors and galilean spacetime and added notes for all material (and also read) up to p.9 in Lewis
 - finished reading section 3.3 in Fleming.
 - added notes for differentiability implying continuity at a point
 - finished "Basics" section of the Rust Book, started reading Intermediate
 - updated Rust, got old n-body code compiling. reviewed the code
 - various improvements to HTML generator

This is not too bad, but there is room for improvement. One interesting thing to note is that I have not yet been able to work within blocks of time (like saying up front "the next hour is for reading X, then I will stop and take a break). It often spills over to 1.5 hours or even longer. I think I'm going to try using alarms on my phone every time I start studying, mostly because I'm interested if I can become more efficient at studying by giving myself less time to work with.

This log got away from me for awhile. I spent awhile looking at various books for taylor's theorem/taylor polynomials/taylor series. This is blocking $N$-body.

I have half a mind to read the presentation in "Analysis by its history" first, followed by chapter 6 of "Understanding Analysis". We can re-evaluate after those are read. Probably want to consult Rudin's presentation of Taylor's theorem as well. After this it will be possible to go back to Aarseth 1.4.

Finished reading section ch 2 (skipped the guessing game) and read "More Strings" and "Iterators" in intermediate.

Starting on Rust book, section 2.11 on Strings.

I just finished reading out of Lewis. I am up to p. 9. I also added notes, so we should be caught up on Lewis. I had some difficulty because I dislike how Lewis presents the material, so I had to slightly reorganize.

By skipping the corollaries of the multivariable MVT and Fleming's stuff on "gradient vector" that followed, I have finished section 3.3. I will start with secton 3.4 next.
