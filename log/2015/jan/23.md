Finished reading section ch 2 (skipped the guessing game) and read "More Strings" and "Iterators" in intermediate.

Starting on Rust book, section 2.11 on Strings.

I just finished reading out of Lewis. I am up to p. 9. I also added notes, so we should be caught up on Lewis. I had some difficulty because I dislike how Lewis presents the material, so I had to slightly reorganize.

By skipping the corollaries of the multivariable MVT and Fleming's stuff on "gradient vector" that followed, I have finished section 3.3. I will start with secton 3.4 next.
