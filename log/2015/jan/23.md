This log got away from me for awhile. I spent awhile looking at various books for taylor's theorem/taylor polynomials/taylor series. This is blocking $N$-body.

I have half a mind to read the presentation in "Analysis by its history" first, followed by chapter 6 of "Understanding Analysis". We can re-evaluate after those are read. Probably want to consult Rudin's presentation of Taylor's theorem as well. After this it will be possible to go back to Aarseth 1.4.

Finished reading section ch 2 (skipped the guessing game) and read "More Strings" and "Iterators" in intermediate.

Starting on Rust book, section 2.11 on Strings.

I just finished reading out of Lewis. I am up to p. 9. I also added notes, so we should be caught up on Lewis. I had some difficulty because I dislike how Lewis presents the material, so I had to slightly reorganize.

By skipping the corollaries of the multivariable MVT and Fleming's stuff on "gradient vector" that followed, I have finished section 3.3. I will start with secton 3.4 next.
