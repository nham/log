The only progress was 

 - clean up of differential calc notes and proving that differentiability at $a$ implies continuity at $a$ (not recorded on computer yet though)

 - some understanding of how Braitenberg Vehicles 2-4 behave

I've decided I should probably try to read every day from each of Fleming, Lee and Beutler. Reading needs to go faster than its been going, because there are many other books I need to be reading as well. Heres a list of some of them as a reminder:

 - *Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems and Linear Algebra* by Hirsch & Smale
 - *Variational Calculus and Optimal Control* by Troutman
 - *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos* by Strogatz
 - *Naive Lie Theory* by Stillwell
 - *Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics* by McCarthy
 - *Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics* by Arnold
 - *Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics* by Sussman & Wisdom
 - *Reinforcement Learning* by Sutton & Barto
 - *Introduction to Topological Manifolds* by Lee
 - *Elementary Differential Geometry* by O'Neill
 - *First Steps in Differential Geometry* by McInerney
 - *An Introduction to Manifolds* by Loring & Tu

Actually, there are many books I'd *like* to read but don't have time to. I should survey all the books I want to read and rank them by priority. Need to figure out how long that would take.

Work on derivatives notes. I did a pass over them and performed some editing/LaTeX cleanup.

I also took a look at Fleming's proof that differentiability at a point implies continuity there. It uses the operator norm, and I think I have a proof (but it is only on paper, not in notes yet.
