    A **topological embedding** is an injective continuous map $f: X \to Y$ such that the codomain restriction $X \to f(X)$ is a homeomorphism

15. A **local homeomorphism** is a function $f: X \to Y$ such that for every $x \in X$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ with 

     - $f(U)$ open in $Y$
     - the two-sided restriction of $f$, $F: U \to f(U)$, is a homeomorphism

    The only use I've ever seen for local homeomorphisms (so far) is in the definition of topological manifolds.
