1. An **algebra** for our purposes here is a non-empty collection of subsets of some set $E$ that is closed under

     - complements
     - finite unions
     - finite intersections

    A **$\sigma$-algebra** is like an algebra, but closed under *countable* unions and intersections instead.

2. A $\sigma$-algebra on $E$ must contain $\emptyset$ and $E$. The $\sigma$-algebra consisting only of these sets is the **trivial $\sigma$-algebra**, while the powerset is the **discrete $\sigma$-algebra**.

3. The intersection of an arbitrary collection of $\sigma$-algebras is again a $\sigma$-algebra. This allows us to *generate* $\sigma$-algebras from an arbitrary collection of subsets: if $\mathcal{C}$ is any collection of subsets of $E$, the **$\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$** is defined to be the intersection of all $\sigma$-algebras on $E$ that contain it. This will be deoted by $\sigma \mathcal{C}$.

4. When $E$ is a topological space, the $\sigma$-algebra generated by its topology is called the **Borel $\sigma$-algebra** on $E$, and will be denoted by $\mathcal{B}_E$. The elements of this $\sigma$-algebra are called **Borel sets**.

5. A **measurable space** is a pair $(X, \mathcal{A})$ where $X$ is a set and $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. The elements of $\mathcal{A}$ are called the **measurable sets**.


6. A **p-system** on $E$ is any collection of subsets that is closed under finite intersection. A **d-system** on $E$ is any collection $\mathcal{D}$ of subsets obeying

     - $E \in \mathcal{D}$
     - if $A, B \in \mathcal{D}$ and $B \subseteq A$, then $A - B \in \mathcal{D}$
     - if $(A_n)$ is a sequence of sets and $A_k \subseteq A_{k+1}$ for all $k$, then $\bigcup_n A_n \in \mathcal{D}$

7. A collection of subsets of $E$ is a $\sigma$-algebra$ on $E$ iff it is simultaneously a p-system and d-system for $E$.

    Clearly any $\sigma$-algebra is both a p-system and d-system. Conversely, any system $\mathcal{C}$ that is both a p-system and a d-system is closed under complements by the first two properties. If $\{A_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is any countable collection of sets, then we have

    $$\bigcup_0^{\infty} A_n = \bigcup_0^{\infty} B_n$$

    where $B_n := \bigcup_1^n A_n$. This reformulation has the advantage of the $B_n$'s being increasing, so we can apply the third p-system axiom to get $\bigcup_0^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{D}$, so $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under countable unions. These two properties prove $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under countable intersection, so $\mathcal{C}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.

8. Here's a lemma that Çinlar states: if $\mathcal{D}$ is a d-system and $D \in \mathcal{D}$, then $\hat \mathcal{D} := \{A \in \mathcal{D} : A \cap D \in \mathcal{D}\}$ is also a d-system for $D$.

    Clearly $D \in \hat \mathcal{D}$. If $A, B \in \hat \mathcal{D}$ and $B \subseteq A$, then since $A \cap D, B \cap D \in \mathcal{D}$, we have $A \cap D - B \cap D = (A - B) \cap D \in \mathcal{D}$ (since $B \cap D \subseteq A \cap D$), so $A - B \in \hat \mathcal{D}$

    Finally, if $(A_n)$ is an increasing sequence in $\hat \mathcal{D}$, then $(A_n \cap D)$ is an increasing sequence in $\mathcal{D}$, so $(\bigcup_0^{\infty} A_n) \cap D = \bigcup_0^{\infty} A_n \cap D \in \mathcal{D}$, so  $\bigcup_0^{\infty} A_n \in \hat \mathcal{D}$.

9. Çinlar calls this the "monotone class theorem", but that doesn't seem to square with what's on wikipedia. Wikipedia seems to call this theorem (first proved by Dynkin) the "$\pi-\lambda$ theorem" instead (it seems an alternate name for p-system is $\pi$-system, and an alternate name for d-system is $\lambda$-system)

    The statement is: any d-system containing some p-system also contains the $\sigma$-algebra generated from the p-system.

    We let $\mathcal{I}$ be a p-system (for some set $E$) and $\mathcal{D}$ be the smallest d-system (for $E$) containing $\mathcal{I}$. The aim is to prove that $\sigma \mathcal{I} \subseteq \mathcal{D}$ (we already have the other direction since $\sigma \mathcal{I}$ is necessarily both a d-system and a p-system).

    But $\sigma \mathcal{I}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{I}$, so it would suffice to prove that $\mathcal{D}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. So we need only prove that it's a p-system.

    Let $A \in \mathcal{I}$. Then

    $$\mathcal{D}_A := \{B \in \mathcal{D} : B \cap A \in \mathcal{D} \}$$

    is also a d-system by the previous lemma. But $\mathcal{D}_A$ contains $\mathcal{I}$ since for all $B \in \mathcal{I}$, $B \cap A \in \mathcal{I}$ (definition of a p-system). So actually $\mathcal{D}_A = \mathcal{D}$, or in other words the intersection of any $\mathcal{D}$-set with any $A \in \mathcal{I}$ is in $\mathcal{D}$.

    But this implies that for any $S \in \mathcal{D}$, $\mathcal{D}_S$ is a d-system containing $\mathcal{I}$. So it must be a superset of $\mathcal{D}$, and so by definition *is* $\mathcal{D}$. This establishes that $\mathcal{D}$ is a p-system.

10. An **outer measure** on any set $X$ is a function $\mu^{\ast}: \text{Pow } X \to [0, \infty]$ that obeys:

     - $\mu^{\ast}(\emptyset) = 0$
     - $A \subseteq B \subseteq X$ implies $\mu^{\ast}(A) \leq \mu^{\ast}(B)$
     - If $\{A_n\}$ is any countable collection of subsets of $X$, then $\mu^{\ast}(\bigcup_1^{\infty} A_n) \leq \sum_1^{\infty} \mu^{\ast}(A_n)$

11. A **measure** on a measurable space $(X, \mathcal{A})$ is a function $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to [0, \infty]$ that obeys:

     - $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
     - If $\{A_n\}$ is any countable, pairwise disjoint collection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$, then $\mu(\bigcup_1^{\infty} A_n) = \sum_1^{\infty} \mu(A_n)$

    To summarize the differences between a measure and an outer measure: outer measures are defined on a power set and are monotone and countably subadditive, while measures are defined on the $\sigma$-algebra of some measurable space and have countable additivity (for disjoint collections).
