<ol type="1">
<li><p>The <strong><span class="math">\(N\)</span>-body problem</strong> is this: There are <span class="math">\(N\)</span> point masses experiencing only gravitational forces from amongst themselves. We assume this system of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> bodies is <strong>isolated</strong>, that is experiences no forces from anything else in the universe.</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that <strong>Newton’s law of gravitation</strong> is that for any two particles at positions <span class="math">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p_2\)</span> with masses <span class="math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(m_2\)</span>, respectively, the force on particle <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, denoted by <span class="math">\(F_i\)</span>, is defined to be</p>
<p><span class="math">\[F_i := G \frac{m_1 m_2}{|p_{i \to j}|^3} p_{i \to j}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\((i,j) = (1,2) \text{ or } (2,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p_{i \to j} := p_j - p_i\)</span> is the vector going from particle <span class="math">\(i\)</span> to particle <span class="math">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that</p>
<p><span class="math">\[|\frac{ p_{i \to j} }{ |p_{i \to j}|^3 }| = \frac{ 1 }{ |p_{i \to j}|^2 }\]</span></p>
<p>which is why it’s often said to be an <em>inverse-square law</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>From (1), (2) and Newton’s second, the <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-body problem defines this system of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> ordinary, coupled, nonlinear differential equations:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\ddot x_i = G \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^N \frac{ m_j }{ |x_{i \to j}|^3 } x_{i \to j}\]</span></p>
<p>where of course <span class="math">\(x_{i \to j} := x_j - x_i\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We are often interested in the case where one body is much more massive (say at least 1000 times more massive) than anything other body. We have such a case for the <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-body system of our solar system (with the massive body of course being the sun, which, as I have stated before, I am trying to eat).</p></li>
<li><p>In such a case as (4), we would be justified in fudging the facts a little and <em>pretending</em> that the massive body does not move. Let us say that <span class="math">\(N = n + 1\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and that body <span class="math">\(0\)</span> is the sun.</p>
<p>If we are pretending that the sun does not move (which is actually true in the limit of <span class="math">\(m_0 \to \infty\)</span>), then we can say that a reference frame fixed to the position of the sun would be an inertial reference frame. We could then define</p>
<p><span class="math">\[r_i(t) := x_i(t) - x_0(t) = x_{0 \to i}(t), (1 \leq i \leq n)\]</span></p>
<p>From this definition we have that <span class="math">\(\ddot r_i = \ddot x_i - \ddot x_0\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(\ddot x_0 = G \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{ m_j }{ |r_j|^3 } r_j\)</span>, after some rearrangement this gives us:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\ddot r_i = G [ 
  \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^n m_j( \frac{ r_j - r_i }{ |r_j - r_i|^3 } - \frac{ r_j }{ |r_j|^3 } ) 
  - (m_0 + m_i) \frac{ r_i }{ |r_i|^3 }
]\]</span></p>
<p>This is an ordinary, coupled, nonlinear system of differential equations, just like the original <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-body equations. One difference is that this is only <span class="math">\(3n\)</span> equations, whereas the original system was <span class="math">\(3n + 3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A solution to the “relative” system of differential equations gives us the trajectories of each planet from a heliocentric coordinate frame. Of course, heliocentrism is an evil lie perpetuated by the lizard people. Just as the sun pulls on all the planets, so do the planets pull on the sun. This means that the sun experiences gravitational forces, and hence acceleration, and so a heliocentric reference frame could not possibly be inertial.</p>
<p>The heliocentric trajectories are a good start, but not an actual solution.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>main term</em> of the equation for <span class="math">\(\ddot r_i\)</span> is the term:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ - (m_0 + m_i) \frac{ r_i }{ |r_i|^3 }\]</span></p>
<p>This is the force per unit mass due to the sun on each particle in the heliocentric frame.</p>
<p>The other term, the one with the sum, is the force (per unit mass) due to all the other bodies in the system. It is called the <em>perturbation term</em> (unless it gets large enough, in which case it may rival the main term in magnitude and thus make the terminology not make sense).</p></li>
<li><p>The center of mass is defined by</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math">\[C(t) := \frac{1}{M} \sum_0^n m_i x_i\]</span>.</p>
<p>It’s simple to prove that <span class="math">\(\ddot C(t) = \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j = 0, j \neq i}^n F_{i \to j} = 0\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(F_{i \to j}\)</span> is the force on particle <span class="math">\(i\)</span> from particle <span class="math">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>For one, the center of mass is by far not the only inertial point definable from the <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>’s. Notice that:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_0^n m_i \ddot x_i = 0\]</span></p>
<p>so that for any <span class="math">\(f(t) := a + tv + c \sum_0^n m_i\)</span> where <span class="math">\(a, v\)</span> are vectors and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is a scalar, we have</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\ddot f = c \sum_0^n m_i \ddot x_i = 0\]</span></p>
<p>So the reason we invent the center of mass is not just because it’s inertial. I believe it’s because both that it’s inertial and that it is the unique trajectory that is, for all time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, in the convex hull of the points. Note that if <span class="math">\(\sum_0^n C m_i x_i(t)\)</span> is a convex combination for all <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, then we must have</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_0^n C m_i = 1\]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math">\[C = \frac{1}{M}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(M := \sum_0^n m_i\)</span>.</p>
