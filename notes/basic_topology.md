1. A **topology** on any set $X$ is a collection of subsets $\mathcal{T}$ of $X$ that is closed under arbitrary union and finite intersection and contains both $\emptyset$ and $X$. The pair $(X, \mathcal{T})$ is said to be a **topological space**. Alternatively, $X$ is said to be a topological space under the topology $\mathcal{T}$. The sets in the topology are said to be the **open subsets** of $X$. A subset $U \subseteq X$ is said to be a **neighborhood** of $x \in X$ if both $x \in U$ and $U$ is open.

2. A point $x \in X$ is said to be an **interior point** of a subset $S \subseteq X$ precisely when there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ contained in $S$. Also, a point $x$ is said to be a **closure point** of $S$ when every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $S$. (Note that every $s \in S$ is a closure point of $S$, but there may be other closure points not in $S$. Not every $s \in S$ is an interior point, on the other hand, but all the interior points must be in $S$). The **interior** of a set $S$ is the collection of interior points, and the **closure** is the set of all closure points.

3. It is straightforward to prove that open subsets are precisely the sets that are equal to their interiors. Analogously to this, we can *define* **closed subsets** to be those sets that are equal to their closures.

4. It turns out that when you use the above definition, you can prove that a set is closed iff its complement is open. This opens up a useful avenue of inquiry via DeMorgan's laws, which allow us to prove that the collection of all closed sets is closed under arbitrary intersection, finite union, and contains both $\emptyset$ and $X$ (yes, $\emptyset$ and $X$ are simultaneously closed and open, a condition often called **clopen**).

5. Another characterization of closure and interior: interior of any set $S$ is the union of all open sets contained in $S$, while the closure of $S$ is the intersection of all closed sets that contain $S$. By these definitions, the interior is the largest open set contained in $S$, and the closure is the smallest closed set containing $S$.
