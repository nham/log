1. Preimages perserve arbitrary union and arbitrary intersection. Intersection is used in the proof of the characteristic property holding for the product topology. I forgot where I used the union version, but I'm confident I used it somewhere.

2. $f(f^{pre}(A))$ is the image of $f^{pre}(A)$ under $f$, which has

    $$f(f^{pre}(A) \subseteq A$$

    (not every element of $A$ may be mapped to by $f$).

    $f^{pre}(f(A))$ is all the points that $f$ maps to $f(A)$, which in general is a superset of $A$ (there may be points outside of $A$ that get mapped into $f(A)$)

    Surjectivity implies equality in the first case, and injectivity implies it in the second.
