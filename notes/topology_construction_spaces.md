1. For any topological space $(X, \mathcal{T})$ and any $A \subseteq X$, consider the set $\iota^{\ast} \mathcal{T} := \{\iota_A^{pre}(U) : U \in \mathcal{T} \}$, where $\iota_A: A \to X$ is the inclusion map. Then $\iota_^{\ast} \mathcal{T}$ is a topology for $A$: it clearly includes $\emptyset$ and $A$, the preimage of an arbitrary union is the union of preimages for any function (so it's closed under unions), and for any $B, C \in \mathcal{T}$, $x \in \iota_A^{pre}(B) \cap \iota_A^{pre}(C)$ iff $x \in A \cap B \cap C = \iota_A^{pre}(B \cap C)$, so it's closed under finite intersections. This topology is called the **subspace topology** on $A$, and it's not hard to see that it is exactly the collection of open sets in $\mathcal{T}$ intersected with $A$.

    We can say more than this though. If $\mathcal{S}$ is any topology on $A$ such that the inclusion $\iota_A$ is continuous, then it must be finer than the subspace topology. In other words, the subspace topology is the *coarsest* topology that makes the inclusion continuous. The proof is quite trivial: if the inclusion is continuous, the pre-image of any open set $U$ in $X$ is open in $\mathcal{S}$. But the preimage is just $U \cap A$.

2. The subspace topology on $A \subseteq X$ obeys what Lee calls the "characteristic property" of the subspace, which is that any map $f: Y \to A$ (where $Y$ is some topological space) is continuous iff $\iota_A \circ f$ is continuous. If $f$ is continuous, $\iota_A \circ f$ certainly must be as well since composition of continuous functions is continuous. Conversely, if $\iota_A \circ f$ is continuous, then for any $U$ open in $A$, $U = A \cap V$ for some $V$ open in $X$, so $(\iota_A \circ f)^{pre}(V) = f^{pre}(U)$ is also open in $Y$, proving $f$ is continuous.

    Presumably Lee calls it the "characteristic topology" because the subspace topology is the *unique* topology on $A$ that has this property. If $A$ equipped with some topology $\mathcal{S}$ has the property that for any $Y$, $f: Y \to A$ is continuous iff $\iota_A \circ f$, by letting $f$ be the identity on $A$ (with same topology $\mathcal{S}$), we can see that $\iota_A$ is continuous, so $\mathcal{S}$ is finer than the subspace topology by (1). 

    Conversely, consider $\phi: A \to A_S$, where $A_S$ is denoting $A$ with the topology $\mathcal{S}$ (this is technically an abuse of notation/nonsense, but it is suggestive!) and $A$ just denotes $A$ with the subspace topology. Then $\iota_A \circ \phi = \iota_A$, which is certainly continuous because $A$ is a subspace. By the characteristic property of $(A, \mathcal{S})$, this means $\phi$ is continuous, which implies (see basic topology notes) that the subspace topology is finer than $\mathcal{S}$. In other words, $\mathcal{S}$ *is* the subspace topology.

3. There are a couple notions of continuous maps that we can now define with subspaces. 

     A **topological embedding** is an injective continuous map $f: X \to Y$ such that the codomain restriction $X \to f(X)$ is a homeomorphism (where $f(X)$ is a subspace of $Y$).

     A **local homeomorphism** is a function $f: X \to Y$ such that for every $x \in X$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ with 

     - $f(U)$ open in $Y$
     - the two-sided restriction of $f$, $F: U \to f(U)$, is a homeomorphism

4. We can also characterize continuous maps locally: if $f: X \to Y$ and for every $x \in X$, there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $f|U_x$ is continuous, then for every $V$ open in $Y$, $f^{pre}(V) \cap U_x$ is open in $U_x$, so $f^{pre}(V) \cap U_x \cap V_x$ is open in $X$ for some $V_x$ open in $X$. If we union these up for all $x$ we get $f^{pre}(V)$ being open.

    The converse is obviously true as well.


4. Above we've proved that the inclusion of a subspace into its superspace is continuous. It's also clearly injective, and what's more if we restrict the codomain to the image we just get the identity map on $A$. So the inclusion defined on a subspace is actually a topological embedding.

5. The restriction $f|S: S \to Y$ of any continuous map $f: X \to Y$ to a subset $S \subseteq X$ is still continuous due $(f|S)^{pre}(V) = f^{pre}(V) \cap S$, which is open by definition of the subspace.

6. The closed subsets in a subspace topology on $A \subseteq X$ are exactly the closed subsets of $X$ intersected with $A$. Proof: $C$ is closed in $A$ iff $A - C$ is open iff $A - C = V \cap A$ for some $V$ open in $X$ iff $C = (X - V) \cap A$.


7. We can talk about transitivity of open and closed sets w.r.t. subspaces: if $U$ is open/closed w.r.t. a subspace $A$ that is open/closed in some space $X$, then $U$ is open/closed in $X$. This is because

    - the intersection of two open/closed sets is again open/closed
    - the subspace's open/closed sets are intersections of open/closed sets in $X$ with $A$

8. Here it is, that moment you've been waiting for: the gluing lemma(s?). If we have either:

     - $B_1, \ldots, B_n$ is a finite closed (w.r.t. $X$) cover of $X$
     - $\{B_i\} is an open (w.r.t. $X$) cover of $X$

    And for each cover element $B_i$ we have a map $f_i: B_i \to Y$ that is continuous, such that for each $i$ and $j$, $f_i$ and $f_j$ are the same on the restriction to $B_i \cap B_j$, then there's a unique continuous map $f: X \to Y$ such that $f|B_i = f_i$ for all $i$.

    *Proof:* In either case, for all $x \in X$, pick an $i$ such that $x \in B_i$. Then define $f(x) = f_i(x)$. This is not only well-defined since $f_i(x) = f_j(x)$ when $x \in B_i \cap B_j$, but $f$ is the only such way to have $f|B_i = f_i$ for all $i$.

    In the case of a finite closed cover we have

    $$f^{pre}(C) = \bigcup_{i=1}^n f_i^{pre}(C)$$

    which, in the case of closed $C$, is a finite union of closed sets (since each $f_i$ is continuous), hence closed in $X$.

    In the case of an open cover we have

    $$f^{pre}(U) = \bigcup_i f_i^{pre}(U)$$

    which, in the case of open $U$, is a union of open sets, hence open in $X$.

9. The subspace $A$ of any Hausdorff space $X$ is also Hausdorff because for any two points in $A$ and any disjoint neighborhoods $U, V$ for the points in $X$, when you intersect $U$ and $V$ with $A$ they're still disjoint (and still neighborhoods, obv.)


10. We seek to define a topology on a finite product of topology spaces. Similar to how the subspace topology was defined, we shall define the **product topology** to be the coarsest topology that makes each projection map $\pi_i: \prod_1^n X_i \to X_i$ continuous. This means that for any $U$ open in $X_i$, we must at least have each set

    $$\prod_1^n X_j \text{ if } j \neq i \text{ else } U$$

    open in $\prod_1^n X_i$

    Furthermore, if we have a collection of $U_i$'s each open in $X_i$, then the intersection of the preimages of these under the $i$-th projection is $\prod_1^n U_i$. So products of open sets must be open.

    The converse is true too. If all products of open sets are open, we can consider the union of all the ones with $U$ in the $i$-th position. This is just

    $$\prod_1^n X_j \text{ if } j \neq i \text{ else } U$$

    So the projections are all continuous.

11. Consider the collection of products of open sets. It covers $\prod_1^n X_i$ (that set is actually in the collection).

    Also, the intersections of products is the product of intersections, any intersection of two such sets is another product of open sets. I.e. the collection of products of open sets is a basis.

    This clearly makes projections continuous, by reasoning in the previous note. The claim is that this is a basis for the product topology.

    But this is true since topologies making projections continuous must contain products of open sets, and thus all unions of such sets.

12. As for the subspace topology, there is a "characteristic property" for the product topology, namely it is the unique topology on $\prod_1^n X_i$ such that functions $f: Y \to \prod_1^n X_i$ are continuous iff the component functions $\pi_i \circ f: Y \to X_i$ are continuous.

    To show that the product topology obeys the property, one direction is easy since any continuous $f$ will have $\pi_i \circ f$ continuous ($\pi_i$ is continuous by the above). Conversely, if $f: Y \to \prod_1^n X_i$ is such that $\pi_i \circ f$ is continuous for all $i$, let $Z = \prod_1^n U_i$ be an element of the product basis. Then $Z = \cap_1^n \pi_i^{pre}(U_i), so $f^{pre}(Z) = \cap_1^n (\pi_i \circ f)^{pre}(U_i)$, which is a finite union of open sets since $\pi_i \circ f$ is continuous by assumption. This proves that $f$ is continuous because the inverse image of any basis element is open.

    To show that no other topologies on $\prod_1^n X_i$ obey the property,let $\mathcal{S}$ be some topology on $\prod_1^n X_i$ that has it. Then defining $\phi$ to be the identity on $\prod_1^n X_i$, each $\pi_i \circ \phi = \pi_i$. But considering $\prod_1^n X_i$ to have topology $\mathcal{S}$, we have that $\phi$ is continuous (being an identity map), so each $\pi_i$ is also continuous, meaning that $\mathcal{S}$ must be finer than the subspace topology by (11).

    Conversely, let $\phi$ again be the identity on $\prod_1^n X_i$, but now consider the domain to have the product topology and the codomain to have topology $\mathcal{S}$. Each $\pi_i \circ \phi$ is just the $i$-th projection on the product topology, which is continuous. But by the characteristic property holding for $\mathcal{S}$, we have that $\phi$ must be continuous, which implies that $\mathcal{S}$ must be coarser than the product topology. In other words, $\mathcal{S}$ *is* the product topology.

13. One thing product spaces affords us is taking the product of continuous maps. If $f_i: X_i \to Y_i$ are continuous maps for $1 \leq i \leq n$, the map $f: \prod_1^n X_i \to \prod_1^n Y_i$ defined by

    $$f(x) = ((f_i \circ \pi_i)(x) : 1 \leq i \leq n)$$

    is called the **product map** of $f_1, \ldots, f_n$. You're probably expecting that we'll prove that $f$ is continuous. You're darned tootin'. Since it suffices to consider basis elements, we have for any $\prod_1^n U_i \subseteq \prod_1^n Y_i$ that $f(x_i : 1 \leq i \leq n) \in \prod_1^n U_i$ iff $f_i(x_i) \in U_i$ for all $i$ iff $x_i \in f_i^{pre}(U_i)$ for all $i$. So 

    $$f^{pre}(\prod_1^n U_i) = \prod_1^n f_i^{pre}(U_i)$$

    which is open since each $f_i$ is continuous. We denote this map by $\prod_1^n f_i$.
