<li><p>A <strong>topology</strong> on any set <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is a collection of subsets <span class="math">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span> of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> that is closed under arbitrary union and finite intersection and contains both <span class="math">\(\emptyset\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. The pair <span class="math">\((X, \mathcal{T})\)</span> is said to be a <strong>topological space</strong>. Alternatively, <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is said to be a topological space under the topology <span class="math">\(\mathcal{T}\)</span>. The sets in the topology are said to be the <strong>open subsets</strong> of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. A subset <span class="math">\(U \subseteq X\)</span> is said to be a <strong>neighborhood</strong> of <span class="math">\(x \in X\)</span> if both <span class="math">\(x \in U\)</span> and <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is open.</p></li>
<li><p>A point <span class="math">\(x \in X\)</span> is said to be an <strong>interior point</strong> of a subset <span class="math">\(S \subseteq X\)</span> precisely when there is a neighborhood <span class="math">\(U\)</span> of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> contained in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. Also, a point <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is said to be a <strong>closure point</strong> of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> when every neighborhood of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> intersects <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. (Note that every <span class="math">\(s \in S\)</span> is a closure point of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, but there may be other closure points not in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. Not every <span class="math">\(s \in S\)</span> is an interior point, on the other hand, but all the interior points must be in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>). The <strong>interior</strong> of a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the collection of interior points, and the <strong>closure</strong> is the set of all closure points.</p></li>
<li><p>It is straightforward to prove that open subsets are precisely the sets that are equal to their interiors. Analogously to this, we can <em>define</em> <strong>closed subsets</strong> to be those sets that are equal to their closures.</p></li>
<li><p>It turns out that when you use the above definition, you can prove that a set is closed iff its complement is open. One can then prove, via DeMorganâ€™s laws, that the collection of all closed sets is closed under arbitrary intersection, finite union, and contains both <span class="math">\(\emptyset\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X\)</span> (yes, <span class="math">\(\emptyset\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X\)</span> are simultaneously closed and open, a condition often called <strong>clopen</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Another characterization of closure and interior: interior of any set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the union of all open sets contained in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, while the closure of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the intersection of all closed sets that contain <span class="math">\(S\)</span>. By these definitions, the interior is the largest open set contained in <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, and the closure is the smallest closed set containing <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>boundary point</strong> of a set is a point that is neither in the interior of the set, nor in the interior of the complement of the set. Equivalently, every neighborhood of a boundary point intersects both <span class="math">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X - S\)</span>. The <strong>boundary</strong> of a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the collection of all boundary points of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>exterior</strong> of a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is defined to be <span class="math">\(\text{int}(X - S)\)</span>. It can be proved that this is always identical to <span class="math">\(X - \text{clo}(S)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Given any set <span class="math">\(S \subseteq X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(X\)</span> can always be partitioned into three disjoint sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>the interior of <span class="math">\(S\)</span></li>
<li>the boundary of <span class="math">\(S\)</span></li>
<li>the exterior of <span class="math">\(S\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The union of the first two is disjoint and yields the closure of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>An <strong>accumulation point</strong> of a set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is some point <span class="math">\(x \in X\)</span> such that every neighborhood of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> intersects <span class="math">\(X - x\)</span>. These points are designed to exclude the <strong>isolated points</strong> of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, which are points <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math">\(S\)</span> such that some neighborhood <span class="math">\(U\)</span> of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> contains no other point of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> other than <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Each isolated point of <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is a closure point of <span class="math">\(S\)</span>, but no isolated point is an accumulation point. So the closure is actually the disjoint union of isolated points and accumulation points.</p></li>
